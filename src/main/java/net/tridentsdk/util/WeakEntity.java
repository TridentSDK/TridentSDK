/**
 * A reference to an entity
 *
 * <p>Three constructors are provided. In the case that the stored value comes from an <em>alien-source</em>, or any
 * general situation where the value to be held by the WeakEntity is unknown and unspecified, the recommended factory
 * method to use is {@link #orEmpty(net.tridentsdk.entity.Entity)}. This prevents the creation of unnecessary instances
 * of WeakEntity where the value is always going to {@code null}. Because this method always returns the same instance
 * of a {@code null} holding WeakEntity, registration does not need to be executed, where registration means to place
 * the reference into a queue which will be cleared once the entity has been removed. In this context, and alien method
 * is: <em>"A method you call for which you have no control over the code, and further donâ€™t even know what the code
 * does, other than the method signature</em> [...] <em>it could refer to calls to third party libraries</em>."</p>
 *
 * <p>Because entities are loaded with all of their data and AI, the removal of them entirely depends on the references
 * left held to it. If the entity is technically removed by the server, but still held by a plugin, for example, then
 * a memory leak will occur because the entity will never actually be removed. It is not updated for players, but the
 * reference stays in memory, wasting computing power on a non-existent entity.</p>
 *
 * <p>Use this class to store a link or bridge to the reference of an entity. The storage of an instance of this class
 * will only hold this class only, and the reference to the entity in this class may become {@code null} at any time,
 * in which case is indicated by {@link #isNull()} returning {@code true}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Much thought was put into the design of this class, especially if it should be made thread-safe. Because this is
 * an internal change, it can be easily done without breaking the API. However, the decision was made to make this
 * class
 * thread-safe in order to preserve the fact that both the users of this API, including plugins and the server itself
 * is concurrent. It would decrease the burden to handle this safely using the internal implementation rather than
 * having the client code execute awkward constructs in order to keep consistency. This is OK for the implementation to
 * perform, but because plugin authors may not always think about the concurrent nature of this API, it was done at the
 * cost of performance to reduce bugs which are often difficult to find.</p>
 *
 * <p>This is the equivalent of {@link com.google.common.base.Optional} but for entities specifically, much like an
 * optional which stores a {@link java.lang.ref.WeakReference} of the specified property. While this class does use
 * WeakReference to manage the references, other methods to safeguard the reference is also implemented, such as
 * removal
 * listeners.</p>
 *
 * <p>Internally, this class manages a queue of references which, in turn, are polled by a thread called
 * {@code Trident - Reference Handler}. Every call to clear a specific reference also runs the mark/sweep collector,
 * although it is invoked directly rather than using {@link #runMarkSweep()}. The implementation of the collector may
 * be
 * found in the documentation for {@link  #runMarkSweep()}. Entities call
 * {@link #clearReferencesTo(net.tridentsdk.entity.Entity)} when they are removed to purge old references to that
 * entity
 * after it has finished despawning. This method also runs the mark/sweep collector. This is only implemented as a
 * safeguard behind {@link java.lang.ref.WeakReference}, which is used to store the actual instance of the entity to be
 * weakly referenced. The reference handling thread cleans up the entity after all the references have been cleared, as
 * well as collecting any other obsolete references. This was done because WeakReference may allow the reference to be
 * held longer than it has lived, in the case that the GC does not run, the reference handler will perform the
 * necessary actions to make sure the entity is correctly nulled.</p>
 *
 * <p>Here are examples on the usage of this class.</p>
 *
 * <p>WeakEntity can and should be used when storing entities, such as players inside a collection or reference.</p>
 * <pre><code>
 *     private final Map&lt;WeakEntity&lt;Player&gt;, Integer&gt; score =
 *         Maps.newHashMap();
 *
 *     // Add player
 *     Player player = ...
 *     int playerScore = ...
 *     score.put(WeakEntity.of(player), playerScore);
 *
 *     // Checking player
 *     for (WeakEntity&lt;Player&gt; weakEntity : score.keySet()) {
 *         // This is simply proof of concept, don't check if it is null
 *         // then try to obtain it
 *         // Or try to hide the player from himself/herself
 *         if (weakEntity.isNull())
 *             continue;
 *         weakEntity.obtain().hide(weakEntity);
 *     }
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <p>WeakEntity acts like an optional which can be used to eliminate the need to check for {@code null}.</p>
 * <pre><code>
 *     // Finding the player
 *     // Don't do this in production-stage code, it doesn't work the way the name implies!
 *     public WeakEntity&lt;Bat&gt; findClosest(Player player, int range) {
 *         for (Entity entity : player.withinRange(range)) {
 *             if (entity instanceof Bat) {
 *                 // Unable to be null, so we use of(Entity)
 *                 // Instead of orEmpty(Entity)
 *                 return WeakEntity.of(entity);
 *             }
 *         }
 *
 *         // No bats near the player, it's empty
 *         return WeakEntity.empty();
 *     }
 *
 *     // Find a Bat closest to the player, or spawn a new one, and accelerate it upwards (just because)
 *     findClosest(player, 69)
 *         .or(EntityBuilder.create().build(TridentBat.class))
 *         .setVelocity(new Vector(0, 10, 0));
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <p>WeakEntity does not need to be instantiated to find in a collection.</p>
 * <pre><code>
 *     Map&lt;WeakEntity&lt;Entity&gt;, Object&gt; map = Maps.newHashMap();
 *     ...
 *     Object o = map.get(WeakEntity.finderOf(entity));
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <p>Finally, WeakEntity can be used to find and prevent bugs which would otherwise cause NullPointerExceptions.</p>
 * <pre><code>
 *     // Using it to find bugs
 *     // Oh, leave it here for a while until I implement a different method, then I'll come back to it
 *     WeakEntity&lt;Player&gt; weakEntity = WeakEntity.of(null);
 *     ...
 *     // I was smart and used obtain() instead of entity()
 *     weakEntity.obtain().hide();
 *
 *     // Code errors
 *
 *     // Go back to the line you found in the stacktrace
 *     // Looks like it was on the line that tried to obtain the entity
 *     // from a WeakEntity
 *     // We remember that we implemented a find player method later on
 *
 *     // Final code
 *     WeakEntity&lt;Player&gt; weakEntity = WeakEntity.of(player());
 * </code></pre>

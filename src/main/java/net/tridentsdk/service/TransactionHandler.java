/**
 * Handles player transactions, such objects, items, and currency
 *
 * <p>This is designed around multiple accounts which are not really accounts, but really a system of synchronizing
 * transactions of a particular type. One account, for example, can be used for economy by one plugin, but that can
 * interfere with another plugin's economy. A new account can be made supporting the same types used in the other plugin
 * without interfering. Additionally, this has the advantage of being able to easily access another plugin's economy
 * data, useful for providing hooks.</p>
 *
 * <p>Example:
 * <pre><code>
 *     // Economy
 *     private static final TransactionHandler handler = Handler.forTransactions();
 *
 *     // This must be static! Or you would end up with many different transactions
 *     // to the wrong account
 *     private static final int ECON_ID = handler.getNewAccount();
 *
 *     // Deposit
 *     handler.deposit(ECON_ID, new Transaction&lt;Player, Player&gt;(int.class, playerFrom, playerTo, 100) {
 *         &#64;Override public void doTransaction(Type type) {
 *             // If check is not required but is a good debugging safeguard
 *             if (type == Type.DEPOSIT) {
 *                 receiver().sendMessage(sender().name() + " has sent you $" + amount());
 *                 // You may give items here as well
 *             }
 *         }
 *     });
 *
 *     // Remove
 *     handler.withdraw(ECON_ID, new Transaction&lt;Player, Player&gt;(int.class, playerTo, playerTo, 100) {
 *         &#64;Override public void doTransaction(Type type) {
 *             // If check is not required but is a good debugging safeguard
 *             if (type == Type.WITHDRAW) {
 *                 sender().sendMessage("You have withdrawn $" + amount());
 *                 // You may give items here as well
 *             }
 *         }
 *     });
 *
 *     // Amount
 *     int amount = handler.amount(ECON_ID, playerTo, int.class);
 * </code></pre></p>
